\section{Introduction}
This paper intends to address a new appoarch of analysis on the optical tweezers formed by vortex array. Chu {\em et al.} have generated a kind of optical tweezers comprised of Ince-Gaussian mode vortex array beams and provided its properties by numerical simulation \cite{SCC08} \cite{Kuo_2013}. M. A Brandes and Julio C. Guti\'{e}rrez-Vega, on the other hand, proposed a new family of solutions to the paraixal wave equation called elliptical beams, which contain Ince-Gaussian modes as special cases \cite{Ban08EB}. In view of this, we seek a new possibility modeling the vortex array by elliptical beams and their properties.

To mathematically model the structure of optical vortices (and therefore vortex array), angualar spectrum method is applied to depict a clear picture. Optical vortices are understood as sigularities, or skew-dislocations, of electromagnetic fields, and therefore inherit novel behaviors near the core. Angular spectrum method successfully explain the drastical phase dip of the vortex core, which make us believe that it is a valuable tool in modeling vortex array. 

The birth and evolution of an optical vortex through an ABCD system have been studied by utilizing circular beams \cite{ValBE16}, which are as well a special case of elliptical beams. Similar to circular beams, elliptical ones also present simple transformation rule through a ABCD optical system. Since the vortex array is generated by Dove prism embedded unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, elliptical beams could also accounts for the vortex arrays by treating the experimental setup as a ABCD system.

The paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:angular_spectrum} gives an overview of angular spectrum method and how it models the vortex behaviors; section \ref{sec:birth_evol} address the rule vortices subject to while going through an ABCD optical system; section \ref{sec:tweezers} reviews the results of vortex array tweezers obtained by Chu {\em et al.}; finally, we provide the treatment of modeling vortex array tweezers by elliptical beams.
